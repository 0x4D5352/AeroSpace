:manpurpose: Runs /bin/bash -c '<bash-script>'

== Synopsis
// tag::synopsis[]
exec-and-wait <bash-script>
// end::synopsis[]

== Description

// tag::body[]
Runs `/bin/bash -c '<bash-script>'`, and waits for the command termination.
Stdout, stderr and exit code are ignored.

*Please prefer `exec-and-forget`*, unless you need to wait for the termination.

You might want to wait for the termination if you have a list of commands, and you want `<bash-script>` to exit until you run the next command.

* The command is available in config
* The command is *NOT* available in CLI

Suppose that you have this binding in your config:

[source,toml]
----
alt-enter = ['exec-and-wait open -n /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app && sleep 1', 'layout floating']
----

It will open up Terminal.app and make it float.
`sleep 1` is still required because `open` returns before the window appears.
