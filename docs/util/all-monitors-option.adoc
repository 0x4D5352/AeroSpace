--all::
Alias for _--on-monitors all_.
Please use this option *with cautious*.
Use it when you really need to get workspaces/windows from *all monitors*.
+
For multi-monitor setup _--on-monitors focused_ is almost always a preferred option.
If you're automating something then you don't want to mess up with workspaces/windows on a different monitor.

With great power comes great responsibility.
