== Description

{manpurpose}

Use this command output to report bug reports about incorrect windows handling
(e.g. some windows are floated when they shouldn't).

The intended usage is the following:

. Run the command to start the debug session recording
. Focus problematic window
. Run the command one more time to stop the debug session recording and print the results

_debug-windows_ command is *not stable API*.
Please *don't rely on* the command existence and output format.
The only intended use case is to report bugs about incorrect windows handling.
