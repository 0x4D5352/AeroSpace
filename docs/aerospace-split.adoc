split [-h|--help] (horizontal|vertical|opposite)
// end::synopsis[]

== Description

*If the parent of currently focused window contains more than one child*, then the command

. Creates a new tiling container
. Replaces currently focused window with the container
. Puts the currently focused window into the container as its the only child

The argument configures orientation of the newly created container.
`opposite` means opposite orientation compared to the parent container.

*If the parent of currently focused window contains only a single child*(the window itself), then `split` command changes the orientation of the parent container

Consider using `join-with` if you want to keep `enable-normalization-flatten-containers` enabled
